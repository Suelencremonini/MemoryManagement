/*
 ViewController used to show a reference cycle created with two classes
 
 The Pet instance holds a strong reference to the Owner instance.
 The Owner instance holds a strong reference to the Pet instance.
 
 So, even it both of them are set to nil, the strong reference between Pet and Owner won't be broken
 
 To solve this problem, define the instance of Pet inside Owner or the instance of Owner inside Pet as weak
